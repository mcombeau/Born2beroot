# Born2beroot
The 42 project Born2beroot explores the fundamentals of system administration by inviting us to instal and configure a virtual machine with VirtualBox.

## Pre-requisites
* [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (6.1 at the time of this writing).
* [Debian](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/) (11.2.0 at the time of this writing).
* Enough free disk space.

## Installation
Installation instructions below are a work in progress.

## Creating a virtual machine in Virtualbox
1. Launch VirtualBox & click New.
3. Name Born2beroot, sotre it in ```/sgoinfre/goinfre/Perso/your_login``` if at 42, or else on a large USB stick. Choose Linux & Debian.
4. ```1024MB``` memory is good.
5. Create a virtual hard disk now.
6. ```VDI```.
7. ```Dynamically allocated```.
8. ```30GB``` if doing bonuses. ```12GB``` is enough if not.
9. Start Born2beroot virtual machine.

## Installing Debian
1. Select Debian ISO image as startup disk.
2. When Debian starts, choose ```Install```, not graphcal install.
3. Choose language, geographical & keyboard layout settings.
4. Hostname must be ```your_login42``` (ex. mcombeau42).
5. Domain name leave empty.
6. Choose strong root password & confirm.
7. Create user. ```your_login``` works for username & name.
8. Choose password for new user.

## Partitioning disks
1. Choose ```Manual``` partitionning.
2. Choose sda Harddisk - ```SCSI (0,0,0) (sda)``` ...
3. ```Yes``` create partition table.

We will crete 2 partitions, the first will be for an unencrypted /boot partition, the other for the encrypted logical volumes :
* ```pri/log xxGB FREE SPACE``` >> ```Create a new partition``` >> ```500 MB``` >> ```Primary``` >> ```Beginning``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```/boot``` >> ```Done```.
* ```pri/log xxGB FREE SPACE``` >> ```Create a new partition``` >> ```max``` >> ```Logical``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```Do not mount it``` >> ```Done```.

### Encrypting disks
1. ```Configure encrypted volumes``` >> ```Yes```.
2. ```Create encrypted volumes```
3. Choose ```sda5``` ONLY to encrypt. We DO NOT want to encrypt the ```sda /boot``` partition.
4. ```Done``` >> ```Finish``` >> ```Yes```.
5. ... wait for formatting to finish...
6. Choose a strong password for disk encryption. DO NOT forget it!

### Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
Create a volume group:
1. ```Configure the Logical Volume Manager``` >> ```Yes```.
3. ```Create Volume Group``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```/dev/mapper/sda5_crypt```.

Create Logical Volumes:
* ```Create Logical Volume``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```root``` >> ```2.8G``` or ```10G``` for bonus
* ```Create Logical Volume``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```home``` >> ```3.8G``` or ```5G``` for bonus
* ```Create Logical Volume``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```swap``` >> ```1G``` or ```2.3G``` for bonus
* ```Create Logical Volume``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```tmp``` >> ```3G```
* ```Create Logical Volume``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```srv``` >> ```3G```
* ```Create Logical Volume``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```var``` >> ```3G```
* ```Create Logical Volume``` >> ```LVMGroup``` >> ```var-log``` >> ```4G```

When done, ```Display configuration details``` to double check & ```Finish```.

Set filesystems and mount points for each logical volume:
* Under "LV home", ```#1 xxGB``` >> ```Use as``` >> ```Ext4``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```/home``` >> ```Done```
* Under "LV root", ```#1 xxGB``` >> ```Use as``` >> ```Ext4``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```/``` >> ```Done```
* Under "LV swap", ```#1 xxGB``` >> ```Use as``` >> ```swap area``` >> ```Done```
* Under "LV srv", ```#1 3GB``` >> ```Use as``` >> ```Ext4``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```/srv``` >> ```Done```
* Under "LV tmp", ```#1 3GB``` >> ```Use as``` >> ```Ext4``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```/tmp``` >> ```Done```
* Under "LV var", ```#1 3GB``` >> ```Use as``` >> ```Ext4``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```/var``` >> ```Done```
* Under "LV var-log", ```#1 4GB``` >> ```Use as``` >> ```Ext4``` >> ```Mount point``` >> ```Enter manually``` >> ```/var/log``` >> ```Done```

Scroll down & ```Finish partitioning and write changes to disk```. ```Yes```.

## Finish Installation
1. ```No```, no need to scan.
2. Choose ```country``` & ```mirror```.
3. Leave proxy field ```blank```.
4. ```No```, no need to participate in study.
5. Uncheck all software.
6. ```Yes```, install GRUB >> ```/dev/sda```
7. ```Continue```.
Installation complete! The virtual machine will now reboot. Enter encryption password and log into created user.

We can verify that the install went correctly by running the following commands:
```bash
$ lsblk
$ cat /etc/os-release
```

...
WIP!
